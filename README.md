## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design, build, and simulate a versatile robotic arm capable of performing a wide range of tasks. The simulation environment will be used to validate control algorithms, test different end-effector configurations, and analyze the robotic arm's performance in different operating conditions.

## Simulation Objectives

- **Motion Planning and Workspace Analysis:** Develop and validate motion planning algorithms for optimizing the robotic arm's trajectories within its workspace.
- **Control Algorithm Validation and Tuning:** Validate and fine-tune control algorithms to achieve precise and efficient motion control of the robotic arm.
- **End-Effector Selection and Manipulation:** Evaluate the performance of different end-effectors and manipulation techniques for various tasks and applications.
- **Sensor Integration and Perception:** Integrate simulated sensors to enable perception capabilities for object detection, localization, and environment sensing.
- **Autonomous Task Execution and Planning:** Develop and test autonomous task execution capabilities to enable the robotic arm to perform complex tasks without human intervention.
