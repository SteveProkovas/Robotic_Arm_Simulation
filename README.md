# Robotic Arm Simulation Project

Welcome to the Robotic Arm Simulation Project! This project aims to develop a general-purpose robotic arm and simulate its behavior in various scenarios.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design, build, and simulate a versatile robotic arm capable of performing a wide range of tasks. The simulation environment will be used to validate control algorithms, test different end-effector configurations, and analyze the robotic arm's performance in different operating conditions.

## Simulation Objectives

- **Motion Planning and Workspace Analysis:**
  - Develop and validate motion planning algorithms for optimizing the robotic arm's trajectories within its workspace.

- **Control Algorithm Validation and Tuning:**
  - Validate and fine-tune control algorithms to achieve precise and efficient motion control of the robotic arm.

- **End-Effector Selection and Manipulation:**
  - Evaluate the performance of different end-effectors and manipulation techniques for various tasks and applications.

- **Sensor Integration and Perception:**
  - Integrate simulated sensors to enable perception capabilities for object detection, localization, and environment sensing.

- **Autonomous Task Execution and Planning:**
  - Develop and test autonomous task execution capabilities to enable the robotic arm to perform complex tasks without human intervention.
